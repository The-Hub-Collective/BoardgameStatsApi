# Boardgame-stats
The goal of this project is to develop an API using C# and .NET Core 9 that supports recording and storing board game session results. Users will be able to input session details such as participating players, scores, and outcomes. The API will ensure reliable data storage for future retrieval and analysis, while maintaining flexibility to support multiple board game types.
